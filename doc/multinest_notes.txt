This is my set of notes for multinest's output, extracted and corrected from
their documentation. The intention is to use these notes for being able to
check multinest's 'opaque' output.

Updated every n_iter replacements (default for pymultinest = 100)

* [root]ev.dat: File with the set of replaced points
    - [n_par columns]: parameters for the loglikelihood function
    - [1]: log likelihood
    - [1]: log prior mass [log( (exp(n-1 / n_live) - exp(n+1 / n_live)) / 2)]
    - [1]: cluster

* [root]live.points: File with the set of alive points (hypercube version)
    - [n_par columns]: parameters for the loglikelihood function
    - [1]: log likelihood

* [root]phys_live.points: File with the set of alive points
    - [n_par columns]: parameters for the loglikelihood function
    - [1]: log likelihood
    - [1]: cluster

* [root]IS.points: File in fortran format with all the points that multinest
         has tried
    - [n_par columns]: parameters for the loglikelihood function
    - [1]: log likelihood
    - [1]: cluster


Updated every 10*n_iter replacements (default for pymultinest = 1000)

* [root].txt: File with points where the sample probability > log_zero
        (default for pymultinest 1e-100)
    - [1]: sample probability [prior mass * likelihood / evidence]
    - [1]: -2 * log likelihood
    - [n_par columns]: parameters for the loglikelihood function

    NOTE: the last n_live points have garbage as the sample probability
            (the prior mass is not really defined for them)
    NOTE2: the sample probability is the likelihood NOT the loglikelihood
            multiplied by the sample probability divided by the evidence NOT
            the log evidence.

* [root]stats.dat: File with the global and local log evidence and its error.
        It also contains the parameter means and their errors along with the
        best fit parameters

* [root]summary.txt: File with the data for each mode (if multimode)
    Each row contains:
        - [n_par columns]: mean parameter values
        - [n_par columns]: mean parameter errors
        - [n_par columns]: best parameter values
        - [n_par columns]: Maximum A Posteriori parameter values
        - [1]: local log evidence
        - [1]: maximum loglikelihood

    NOTE: The first row also contains the INS log evidence and its error
