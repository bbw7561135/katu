# Tests for electron cooling
#
# The escape timescale (t_esc) for an sphere goes as
# 3/4 * R / c, so for R = 1e16 we have
# t_esc ~ 250173s
#
# The cooling factor for synchrotron cooling (S) goes as
# 4/3 * c * Sigma_T * B^2 / 8*pi / m_e c^2
# ~ 1.29e-9 * B^2
#
# And the equilibrium Gamma between acceleration and cooling (g_eq) goes as
# 1 / t_acc S
#
# The point between fast and slow cooling in an injection is around
# g ~ 1 / (p - 1) S t_esc
#
#
# We choose a value of the magnetic field of 0.1, and a value for the
# acceleration timescale of 1e128 which allows for all electrons to be
# cooled quickly
#
# In this regime, we expect that below the lowest energy where we inject
# the electron population behaves as a power law with
# n_e * A * \gamma^(-2)

# Note that we set eta = 1e-10 so that the population of protons is very low
