# Tests for the Benchmarks of HÃ¼mmer et al. 2010
#
# We have 3 different benchmarks, GRB, AGN and BB all with different
# populations for protons and photons.
#
# NOTE: we use some of this machinery to get the populations in an appropiate
# state, but some code has to be used in order to get the correct populations.
#
# Also note that we set eta to 10^10 so that we do not have electrons. And that
# the normalization constants can be whatever, as we are only interested
# in the functional form of the results, not their magnitude.
#
# Also note that we do not care about the evolution, as we just need the
# data of the pion production with the initial distributions. Thus, L = 0
