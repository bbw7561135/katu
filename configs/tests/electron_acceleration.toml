# Tests for electron acceleration
#
# The escape timescale (t_esc) for an sphere goes as
# 3/4 * R / c, so for R = 1e16 we have
# t_esc ~ 250173s
#
# The cooling factor for synchrotron cooling (S) goes as
# 4/3 * c * Sigma_T * B^2 / 8*pi / m_e c^2
# ~ 1.29e-9 * B^2
#
# And the equilibrium Gamma between acceleration and cooling (g_eq) goes as
# 1 / t_acc S
#
#
# We choose a value of the magnetic field of 0.001, which gives an equilibrium
# energy of ~ 3.1e9. High enough for allowing the system to freely accelerate
# and low enough to not generate enough synchrotron photons that change
# substantially the equilibrium energy through Inverse Compton cooling
#
# In this regime, we expect that beyond the highest energy where we inject
# the electron population behaves as a power law with
# n_e * A * \gamma^(-1 - t_acc / t_esc) (MK95)

# Note that we set eta = 1e-10 so that the population of protons is very low
